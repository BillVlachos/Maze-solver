# Maze solver
This a game written in python where you create a maze or it is randomly generated and an object finds the fastest solution.

In order for the program to run, the image files (bgimg.png, obstacle.png, space_webp.png, ufo.png) and the sound files (short_beep_v2.wav, start.wav, ufo_landing.wav) must be in the same folder as the python file (Maze_solver.py) of the program.

I have also included a presentation/report of the project. I want to emphasize that this in not an individual project as I created it with two of my peers in the uni, Fotis Gkonos and Markos Kordas.
